                The idea of a World Wide Web originated in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher for CERN, proposed the creation of a global hypertext project, which by 1993 evolved into what we know as the World Wide Web. Major events between 1989 and 1993 include the WWW Virtual Library, the publishing of a document entitled HTML Tags, HTTP v0.9, ViolaWWW, BBEdit HTML and text editor, and the popularization of search engines.

                Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee also known as <a href='https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/'>TimBL</a>, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first website at <a href='https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web'>CERN</a> – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer.

                The internet stems from the proposal for a <a href='https://www.w3.org/Proposal.html'>Global hypertext project</a>.

                The <a href='http://vlib.org/admin/AboutVL'>WWW Virtual Library</a> is the oldest catalogue of the Web started by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of HTML and of the Web itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML1 is a name for Tim Berners-Lee's original HTML. These tags are taken from a document titled <a href='http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html'>"HTML Tags"</a> , no author shown but we assume it was written by Tim Berners-Lee.

            <p>
                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an Internet protocol designed to exchange hypertext documents (images, websites, etc.) between the server and the web browser. The first protocol design, later called <a href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/http-v0-9-1991'>HTTP v0.9</a>, was created by Tim Berners-Lee as part of the WWW service specification. The HTTP v0.9 version was extremely simple, using only the GET method with one parameter, i.e. the name of the requested document.

                Pei-Yuan Wei developed the <a href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/violawww-1992'>ViolaWWW</a> browser for Unix while he was working at the University of California at Berkeley.
