                In 1996 the World Wide Web Started becoming what I as a 90’s baby know as the early internet. The time period from 1996 to 1998 saw the introduction and further refinement of some of the most important aspects of the internet as we know it. Many notable events include Alexa Internet, The Internet Archive, Jscript, CSS1 and 2, Macromedia Flash 1.0, HTML 3.2-4.0, the Web Accessibility Initiative, Search Engine Optimization, Internet Explorer 4.0, DHTML, Dreamweaver 1.0, XML 1.0, Mozilla, and on September 4th, 1998 Google.

                At the end of 1995, W3C set up the HTML Editorial Review Board (HTML ERB) to ratify future HTML specifications.

The battles within the HTML ERB were long and hard, but CSS level 1 finally emerged as a W3C Recommendation in December 1996. Shortly after, CSS level 2 became a Recommendation in May 1998
