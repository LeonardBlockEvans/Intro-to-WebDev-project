# Intro-to-WebDev-project
Project made for my web development class. 

Originally this class was meant to have two main projects but they were combined into one.  This lead to some features I wanted being cut (I would have liked to demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript specifically), less polish than intended, and the addition of features that are not as fleshed out as I would have liked.  

This projects shows use of HTML and CSS to make a minimal and responsive website that has Nav bars and buttons, Tables, and a submission form with regular expression checks on the inputs.
