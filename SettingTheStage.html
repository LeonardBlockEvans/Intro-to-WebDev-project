                In 1994 the World Wide Web was rapidly expanding in all directions. In this time the first bot countermeasures were established, and the first HTML validator was created. On October 1st, 1994 the W3C was founded to develop standards for the World Wide Web, standards for markup languages that would come to include HTML, XHML, XML, and CSS, and to be an educational resource. The rest of 1994 through 1995 saw the rise of many important tools and websites used today including PHP 1.0, Amazon, Internet explorer, eBay, HTML 2.0, and finally JavaScript 1.0 which was released on December 4 forth 1995.
