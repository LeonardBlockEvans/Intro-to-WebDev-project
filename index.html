            <h>Welcome to a Short History of Web Design</h>
            <P>
                On this website, I’ll give a brief introduction to the major events that have shaped website design into what it is today and look into the current events that will shape the future.

            <p>

                The idea of a World Wide Web originated in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher for CERN, proposed the creation of a global hypertext project, which by 1993 evolved into what we know as the World Wide Web. Major events between 1989 and 1993 include the WWW Virtual Library, the publishing of a document entitled HTML Tags, HTTP v0.9, ViolaWWW, BBEdit HTML and text editor, and the popularization of search engines.

            <p>

                In 1994 the World Wide Web was rapidly expanding in all directions. In this time the first bot countermeasures were established, and the first HTML validator was created. On October 1st, 1994 the W3C was founded to develop standards for the World Wide Web, standards for markup languages that would come to include HTML, XHML, XML, and CSS, and to be an educational resource. The rest of 1994 through 1995 saw the rise of many important tools and websites used today including PHP 1.0, Amazon, Internet explorer, eBay, HTML 2.0, and finally JavaScript 1.0 which was released on December 4 forth 1995.

                In 1996 the World Wide Web Started becoming what I as a 90’s baby know as the early internet. The time period from 1996 to 1998 saw the introduction and further refinement of some of the most important aspects of the internet as we know it. Many notable events include Alexa internet, The Internet Archive, Jscript, CSS1 and 2, Macromedia Flash 1.0, HTML 3.2-4.0, the Web Accessibility Initiative, Search Engine Optimization, Internet Explorer 4.0, DHTML, Dreamweaver 1.0, XML 1.0, Mozilla, and on September 4th, 1998 Google.

            <p>

                From 1999 to Mid-2003 a focus is put on the design of webpages. During this time web designers began exploring what was possible with early markdown languages, flash, Scalable Vector Graphics, and responsive websites.
                The popularization of these tools led to lots of experimentation with web design both functionally and visually. Highlights of this era include the WCAG 1.0, Adobe Photoshop 5.5, Zombo.com, Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity and Don’t Make Me Think (books over UX design), XHTML 1.0, PHP 4.0, DeviantArt, Macromedia Flash 5.0 and ActionScript 1.0, Wikipedia, Internet Explorer 6.0, SVG 1.0, Wayback Machine, Audi.com, CSS Zen Garden, WordPress 0.7, and safari 1.0.

            <p>

                Entering the modern era of web design, we’ll see many of the major influences leading to the current events surrounding web design. The time period between late 2003 and 2010 introduced many modern tools that shaped the web we see today and also saw the meteoric rise of social media. Notable events, tools, and sites during this time include MySpace, Firefox 1.0, Youtube, Reddit, the Million Dollar Homepage, Google Analytics, jQuery, iPhone, CSS-Tricks, CSS Grid, Google Chrome, WCAG 2.0, Facebook and the like button, CSS Flexible Box Layout, and Google Web Fonts.
            </p>
            <h>Current events</h>
            <p>

                While still in the “modern” era of web design, many events from 2011 through 2017 highlight where web development currently is, and where it is heading. Currently, web development has seen the refinement of tools and frameworks, advancements in adaptive web page rendering, improving design techniques, evolving browsers, and the phasing out of flash player.
                Important highlights include Bootstrap 1 through 3, Media Queries specification, Material Design, HTML5, Microsoft Edge, and the phasing out of flash player with its last update being on December 31st, 2020.
