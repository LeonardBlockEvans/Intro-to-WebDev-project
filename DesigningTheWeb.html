            <p>

                From 1999 to Mid-2003 a focus is put on the design of webpages. During this time web designers began exploring what was possible with early markdown languages, flash, Scalable Vector Graphics, and responsive websites.
                The popularization of these tools led to lots of experimentation with web design both functionally and visually. Highlights of this era include the WCAG 1.0, Adobe Photoshop 5.5, Zombo.com, Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity and Don’t Make Me Think (books over UX design), XHTML 1.0, PHP 4.0, DeviantArt, Macromedia Flash 5.0 and ActionScript 1.0, Wikipedia, Internet Explorer 6.0, SVG 1.0, Wayback Machine, Audi.com, CSS Zen Garden, WordPress 0.7, and safari 1.0.

                The <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG'>SVG</a> specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium since 1999. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files.

                W3C, in co-operation with the WAI initiative, issued the first recommendation for a set of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <a href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/wcag-1-0-1999'>(WCAG 1.0)</a>. The WCAG 1.0 consists of 14 general rules that represent the basic principles of accessibility.

                Adobe Photoshop 5.5 was released for Mac and Windows in February 1999, just nine months after the release of Photoshop 5.0.
                With more designers than ever using <a href='https://www.fastprint.co.uk/blog/the-evolution-of-photoshop-25-years-in-the-making.html#:~:text=Adobe%20Photoshop%205.5%20was%20released,the%20release%20of%20Photoshop%205.0.&text=Many%20of%20the%20features%20of,developers%20codename%20for%20Photoshop%205.5.'>Adobe Photoshop</a> for web design projects, Adobe added a massive time-saving feature in version 5.5; "Save for Web". This allowed designers to save their images using an in-built preset which optimised images for use on the web.

                Jakob Nielsen, an expert in web design and web usability, published <a href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/jakob-nielsen-published-a-book-designing-web-usability-the-practice-of-simplicity-1999'>Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity</a>. The book became one of the basic handbooks in the field of web usability and the emerging field of user experience design (UX).

                Steve Krug, a UX designer and information architect, published <a href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/steve-krug-published-a-book-don-t-make-me-think-2000'>Don’t Make Me Think</a>. The book deals with web usability and the interdisciplinary field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In his publication, Steve Krug develops the idea that a well-designed computer program or website should allow users to perform their intended tasks in the simplest way possible, without having to think hard about how to perform them.

                A pair of Israeli programmers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, completely rewrote the interpreter used in PHP and created version <a href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/php-4-0-and-zend-engine-2000'>PHP 4.0</a>. PHP 4.0 is based on an open source scripting engine called Zend Engine. The name Zend is a composite of its creators’ names Zeev and Andi. The Zend Engine is written as a highly optimized and powerful backend that can also be used outside PHP applications.

The program was released with Flash Player 5.

                Zombo.com was launched in 1999 as a joke poking fun at how websites would play a small Flash animation before actually transitioning into the main page. It took this concept to the extreme, playing small animation along with a repeating tune with a voice track welcoming the visitor to <a href='http://www.zombo.com/'>zombo.com</a>. After some time, an option to purchase T-shirts or sign up for a newsletter would appear, and if neither were clicked, the loop would resume indefinitely.
