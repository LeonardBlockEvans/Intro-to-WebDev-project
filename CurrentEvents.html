                While still in the “modern” era of web design, many events from 2011 through 2017 highlight where web development currently is, and where it is heading. Currently, web development has seen the refinement of tools and frameworks, advancements in adaptive web page rendering, improving design techniques, evolving browsers, and the phasing out of flash player.
                Important highlights include Bootstrap 1 through 3, Media Queries specification, Material Design, HTML5, Microsoft Edge, and the phasing out of flash player with its last update being on December 31st, 2020.

                A <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/'>media query</a> consists of a media type and zero or more expressions that check for the conditions of particular media features. Among the media features that can be used in media queries are ‘width’, ‘height’, and ‘color’. By using media queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself.
