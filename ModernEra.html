            <p>

                Entering the modern era of web design, we’ll see many of the major influences leading to the current events surrounding web design. The time period between late 2003 and 2010 introduced many modern tools that shaped the web we see today and also saw the meteoric rise of social media. Notable events, tools, and sites during this time include MySpace, Firefox 1.0, Youtube, Reddit, the Million Dollar Homepage, Google Analytics, jQuery, iPhone, CSS-Tricks, CSS Grid, Google Chrome, WCAG 2.0, Facebook and the like button, CSS Flexible Box Layout, and Google Web Fonts.
